        If you choose to add a publication, fill out as many fields as possible. If you choose to update an existing publication, only fill out the required and the fields that you want to modify. Leave everything else blank.

        When updating an existing publication, the automated script will try to find a file at `_posts/papers/<year>-<month>-<day>-<shorthand>.md` and update that. Thus, make sure you are entering all 4 fields correctly.

        This form will automatically generate a PR that will be reviewed by the maintainers.
