## Abstract

Universal Dependencies (UD) offer a uni-form cross-lingual syntactic representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications. Recent work shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic dependencies to logical forms. However, this work is lim-ited to English, and cannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such as control. In this work, we introduce UD EP L AMBDA , a semantic interface for UD, which maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent fashion and can process dependency graphs. We per-form experiments on question answering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation. Results show that UD EP L AMBDA outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets. For English, it achieves a 4.9 F 1 point improve-ment over the state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions.
