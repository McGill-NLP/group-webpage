## Abstract

Universal Dependencies (UD) provides a cross-linguistically uniform syntactic representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications of parsing and natural language understanding. Reddy et al. (2016) recently developed a semantic interface for (English) Stanford Dependencies, based on the lambda calculus. In this work, we introduce UD EP L AMBDA , a similar semantic interface for UD, which allows mapping natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent framework. We evaluate our approach on semantic parsing for the task of question answering against Freebase. To facilitate multilingual evaluation, we provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets. Results show that UD EP L AMBDA outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets. For English, it achieves the strongest result to date on GraphQuestions, with competitive results on WebQuestions. Abstract This supplementary material to Universal Semantic Parsing , provides and outline of how quantiﬁcation can be incorporated in the UD EP L AMBDA framework.
