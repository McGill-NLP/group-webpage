## A bit of history

The McGill NLP reading group was originally started by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) in 2015. You can find previous talk topics [here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/meetings.html). The reading group is now held at Mila in a hybrid fashion and is currently organized by Vaibhav Adlakha and Arian Hosseini. To join the mailing list, send an e-mail to compling-owner [@cs.mcgill.ca].
