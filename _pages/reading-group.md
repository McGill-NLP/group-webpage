The McGill NLP reading group hosts speaker presentations and NLP-related discussions in a hybrid fashion at Mila. It is called the McGill NLP reading group for historical reasons, but actively gathers NLP researchers from different Mila-affiliated research institutes across Montreal (McGill University, University of Montreal, etc.).

## Organizers

The current organizers are Cesare Spinoso, Ori Ernst and Vaibhav Adlakha. For more information about the reading group or for requests to join the mailing list, send an e-mail to the organizers at `compling-owner at cs dot mcgill dot ca`. Note that this mailing list is used for people outside of Mila. If you already have a Mila email, you will automatically receive reading group announcements through the `mila-event-announcement` list.


## Schedule

For the Summer 2024 semester, the reading group will meet every other Monday starting April 22nd at 11AM (with some exceptions to be expected). Meetings will be held in a hybrid fashion. More information including room locations, Zoom link and Google calendar link will be found in the emails we will send announcing speakers/discussion topics both to the Mila-wide email and the CompLing mailing list. Below is a tentative schedule of speakers/topics for the semester. All times are in EST.

## History

The McGill NLP reading group was originally started by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) in the summer of 2015 at McGill and was originally called the Computational Linguistics (CompLing) reading group. In 2019, the CompLing reading group (McGill-specific) merged with the Language Understanding reading group (Mila-wide) to become what it is today. Previous reading group organizers have been: Jackie Cheung (2015), Jad Kabbara (2016), Ali Emami (2017), Yue Dong (2018), Kushal Arora (2019), Aishik Chakraborty (2020), Ian Porada (2021), Arian Hosseini (2019 to 2023).
