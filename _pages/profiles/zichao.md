## Bio
He is a PhD student working with Prof. Siva Reddy and Prof. Jackie Cheung. He has broad research interests in NLP, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. His work covers a diverse set of topics, including question answering, logical reasoning, probing, LLM editing, and evaluation. More recently, he has been working on understanding and modeling digital environments.

During his PhD, he completed a Mitacs internship at Borealis AI and is currently doing another Mitacs internship at ServiceNow, where he is working on knowledge organization and web understanding.

## Research topics
The main theme of his research is understanding and enhancing the adaptation of LLM to align with the semantic structure of the external world, such as:

* How the adaptation of LLMs/VLMs align with the transition dynamics of world (such as fictional world and digital world)? Do they capture the core abstractions to predict the future state?
* How does knowledge updating and reasoning in LLMs align with the dependencies in (probabilistic) knowledge bases? Do they adhere to the principle of maximal knowledge consistency?
* Do LLM representations induce a hierarachical organization of documents and knowledge? How to evaluate, probe/inspect and improve them?
