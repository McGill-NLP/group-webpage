# Description

  This course is a seminar-style course that focuses on advances in multilingual representation learning and how to scale language technologies to many languages of the world including high-resource languages (e.g. English and French), mid-resource languages (e.g. Indonesia and Swahili) and low-resource languages (e.g. Wolof and Quechua)  ,  and some multimodal applications to images and speech. In the first four lectures, I will provide an overview of multilingual NLP, text embedding models, cross-lingual transfer learning and open problems in NLP. 

# Prerequisites

  One of the following McGill courses: Natural Language Processing (COMP 550), Natural Language Understanding with Deep Learning (COMP 545), Applied Machine Learning (COMP 551), or a relevant NLP course at other universities. If you are unsure, email me.
 
# Grading (tentative)

  
    This is a demanding course in terms of participation and projects. All deadlines start after the Add/Drop deadline (Tuesday January 14, 2025)

    ● Presenting papers in class (20%): After the first few lectures, each student should form a group of two for joint presentation. Not on the same topic you wrote a technical review for. 

    ● Leading paper discussions in a class (10%): Sign up as panelists for at least twice to critically analyze the presented papers.

    ● In-class Project Proposal presentation (5%): To get quick feedback on your proposed project. 

    ● Project (40%):  You will do a project in groups of two. This involves

        Literature review (10%)

        Baselines (5%)

        Final paper with new experiments and code submission (15%)

        Final presentation at the end of term (10%)
