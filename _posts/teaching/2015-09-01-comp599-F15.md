# Description

This course presents an introduction to the computational modelling of natural language. Topics covered include: language modelling, syntactic parsing, lexical and compositional semantics, and discourse analysis. We will consider selected applications such as automatic summarization, machine translation, and speech processing. We will also study machine learning paradigms and algorithms that are used in natural language processing, including neural network architectures.
