## Overview

The last decades have seen phenomenal increases in our scientific and engineering understanding of language from a computational perspective. A large part of this success has been the rapid and unprecedented expansion of different kinds of language data as well as new computational tools for dealing with this data. This course provides an introduction to the data science of language. The emphasis will be on learning basic tools for working with language data for both engineering and scientific applications.

## Goals

The goal of this course is to learn how to think about language data (predominantly raw text) and to work with it computationally. Along the way, we will learn a number of mathematical and computational tools for data collection, representation, processing, modeling, and analysis. The main emphasis of the course will be on transferring theory into practice. By the end of the course, you will know how to visualize large amounts of text, study the nature of words, build thesaurus, search for information, predict outcomes from social media text while also studying the ethical implications. And one of the side goals is to have fun with text!!

#### Students will:

- Learn to visualize text.
- Learn how to analyze text data using simple statistical methods.
- Learn how to build simply models of language domains.
- Learn how to predict outcomes based on text.
- Learn the biases of current NLP technology and their implications.
- Learn how to process different kinds of language data using Python.
- Learn how to query linguistic databases.

# Prerequisites

Required: Programming background at the level of COMP 202 or equivalent.

Recommended: Programming background at the level of COMP 250 or higher. Mathematics background at the level of MATH 240. Basic calculus and linear algebra will be helpful but not critical.

# Grading

Note that the details below are subject to change. There is no exam.

- Warm-Up Problem Sets 1 and 2 (20%): These will be a warm-up to get used to implementing Python and submitting (10% each)
- Problem Sets (80%): 4 problem sets equally weighted (20% each).
