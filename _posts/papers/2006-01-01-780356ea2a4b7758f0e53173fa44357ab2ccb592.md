## Abstract

The first goal of this paper is to provide readers with a background to the cultural and educational conditions observed and researched about Korea. The second objective is to perform a current review of CALL (computer aided/assisted language learning) use in second language acquisition and to determine if any literature exists specifically about the use of CALL in Korean EFL (English as a Foreign Language) classrooms. The final objective is to relate the current use of CALL to the Korean EFL context through the literature available and personal experience in an attempt to determine if CALL should be used in Korea.
