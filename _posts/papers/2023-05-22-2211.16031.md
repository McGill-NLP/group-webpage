## Abstract

Syntax is a latent hierarchical structure which underpins the robust and compositional nature of human language. An active line of inquiry is whether large pretrained language models (LLMs) are able to acquire syntax by training on text alone; understanding a model’s syntactic capabilities is essential to understanding how it processes and makes use of language. In this paper, we propose a new method, SSUD, which allows for the induction of syntactic structures without supervision from gold-standard parses. Instead, we seek to deﬁne formalism-agnostic, model-intrinsic syntactic parses by using a property of syntactic relations: syntactic substitutability. We demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative gains on dependency parsing tasks using SSUD, and induce syntactic structures which we hope provide clarity into LLMs and linguistic representations, alike.
