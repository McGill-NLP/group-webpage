## Abstract

We study the utility of incorporating entity type abstractions into pre-trained Transformers and test these methods on four NLP tasks requiring diﬀerent forms of logical reasoning: (1) compositional language understanding with text-based relational reasoning (CLUTRR), (2) abductive reasoning (ProofWriter), (3) multi-hop question answering (HotpotQA), and (4) conversational question answering (CoQA). We propose and empirically explore three ways to add such abstraction: (i) as additional input embeddings, (ii) as a separate sequence to encode, and (iii) as an auxiliary prediction task for the model. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that models with abstract entity knowledge performs better than without it. The best abstraction aware models achieved an overall accuracy of 88.8% and 91.8% compared to the baseline model achieving 62.9% and 89.8% on CLUTRR and ProofWriter respectively. However, for HotpotQA and CoQA, we ﬁnd that F1 scores improve by only 0.5% on average. Our results suggest that the beneﬁt of explicit abstraction is signiﬁcant in formally deﬁned logical reasoning settings requiring many reasoning hops, but point to the notion that it is less beneﬁcial for NLP tasks having less formal logical structure.
