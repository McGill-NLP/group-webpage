## Abstract

In this paper, we create NaijaRC: a new multi-choice Reading Comprehension dataset for three native Nigeria languages that is based on high-school reading comprehension examination. We provide baseline results by performing cross-lingual transfer using existing English RACE and Belebele training dataset based on a pre-trained encoder-only model. Additionally, we provide results by prompting large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.
