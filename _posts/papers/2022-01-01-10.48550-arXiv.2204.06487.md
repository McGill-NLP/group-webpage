## Abstract

and XLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classiﬁcation, and sentiment classiﬁcation) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on individual languages while requiring signiﬁcantly less disk space. Finally, we show that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer abilities of parameter efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning methods.
