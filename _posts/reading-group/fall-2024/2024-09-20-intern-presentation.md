The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is thrilled to showcase the work of our McGill NLP interns who will each be giving 10 minute talks (5 minutes of QA) to the group. The speakers will be [Fabian David Schmidt](https://fdschmidt93.github.io/), [Ada Tur](https://adadtur.github.io/).

More information about each talk below.

# Fabian David Schmidt

## Talk Description

LLMs have become a go-to solution not just for text generation, but also for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Acquiring extensive knowledge through language modeling on web-scale corpora, they excel on English NLU, yet struggle to extend their NLU capabilities to underrepresented languages. In contrast, machine translation models (MT) produce excellent multilingual representations, resulting in strong translation performance even for low-resource languages. MT encoders, however, lack the knowledge necessary for comprehensive NLU that LLMs obtain through language modeling training on immense corpora. In this work, we get the best both worlds by integrating MT encoders directly into LLM backbones via sample-efficient self-distillation. The resulting MT-LLMs preserve the inherent multilingual representational alignment from the MT encoder, allowing lower-resource languages to tap into the rich knowledge embedded in English-centric LLMs for successful cross-linugal transfer at scale. We further sketch how MT decoders and generative LLMs may be interleaved to enable high-quality natural language generation for underrepresented languages.

## Bio

Fabian David Schmidt is a fourth year PhD student at University of WÃ¼rzburg. He is broadly interested in building multilingual NLP systems that robustly scale to lower-resource languages. He is currently doing a research internship on massively multilingual causal language models with David Adelani.

# Ada Tur: Constituent Movement with Large Language Models

## Talk Description

Though English sentences are typically flexible vis-a-vis word order, post-verbal constituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory presents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with constituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such theories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP), because while recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to significant gains in the performance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how these models process language, and how this compares to human language processing. In particular, the question of if LLMs display the same patterns with post-verbal constituent shifting remains, and may provide insights into existing theories on when and how the shift occurs in human language.
