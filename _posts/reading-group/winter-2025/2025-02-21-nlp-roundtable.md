The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is happy to have a roundtable discussion with members of the Mila community about the reviewing process in NLP (i.e, *CL conferences) as well as in other fields. This is a great opportunity for researchers at Mila working in NLP to get to know each other and to share their thoughts and insights about the review process.


## Roundtable Description

The topic of the roundtable will be about the reviewing process both in NLP (*CL conferences) as well as NLP-related fields (e.g., ML/DL conferences). We will have a round of introduction and then some questions to prompt discussion among us. In-person attendance is highly encouraged!

Date: February 21st<br>
