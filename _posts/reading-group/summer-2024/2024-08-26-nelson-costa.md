The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is happy to receive [Nelson Filipe Costa](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=rWV9FaoAAAAJ&hl=en) who will be giving a talk **in-person** on "Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition".

## Talk Description

In this presentation, we address the inherent ambiguity in Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR) by introducing a novel multi-task classification model capable of learning both multi-label and single-label representations of discourse relations. Leveraging the DiscoGeM corpus, we train and evaluate our model on both multi-label and traditional single-label classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work presents the first truly multi-label classifier in IDRR, establishing a benchmark for multi-label classification and achieving SOTA results in single-label classification on DiscoGeM. Additionally, we evaluate our model on the PDTB 3.0 corpus for single-label classification without any prior exposure to its data. While the performance is below the current SOTA, our model demonstrates promising results indicating potential for effective transfer learning across both corpora.
