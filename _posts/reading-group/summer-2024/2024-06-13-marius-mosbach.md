The [NLP Reading Group]({% link _pages/reading-group.md %}) is happy to have [Marius Mosbach](https://mmarius.github.io/) who will be giving a talk about "From Insights to Action: The Role of Analysis Work in NLP".

## Talk Description

In my talk, I will cover two recent examples of analysis work on weakly supervised learning and universal embedding models. Both are good examples for how analysis work can highlight methodological issues with previous work and lead to unexpected results. In the remainder of the talk, I will take a broader perspective on the role of analysis work within NLP and ask: How does interpretability and analysis research influence NLP researchers in what they choose to work on, what they cite, what they build, and how they think about NLP altogether? I will present answers to these questions based on our recent work for which we surveyed the NLP community and analyzed citation patterns in ACL and EMNLP publications over the past five years.

Note: This is a practice talk for a keynote at the Insights from Negative Results Workshop at NAACL 2024. Critical feedback is welcome :) 

## Speaker Bio
