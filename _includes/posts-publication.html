  Ideally we want to use:
  {% assign posts = posts | where_exp: "post", "post.names contains include.author or post.author == include.author" %}

  However it is not currently supported by Jekyll 3.9.2, which is what is being used by the GitHub Pages Gem. However,
  the gem maintainers are currently working on upgrading jekyll to 4.x, which supports binary operator for where_exp:
